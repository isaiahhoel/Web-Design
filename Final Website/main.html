                    Welcome to my Website! I have studied and worked hard to create this site so I hope you enjoy!
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    My full name is Isaiah Patrick Hoelscher and have grown up my whole life in Union, MO with my
                    Mom and Dad. I Graduated from Union HS in 2020 and have since been at Hannibal-LaGrange University 
                    studying Computers and playing both track and baseball. I enjoy all sports and love to challenge myself 
                    to perfect each one. I also enjoy exploring the outdoors, traveling, and playing video games.

                    Family has been one of the biggest influences in my life, whether it was bad influences 
                    that would get me in trouble or good influences that would set me up for success later in life.
                    I have 3 sibilings, two sisters and one brother, each of them have four kids and two of my older nieces have kids totaling 
                    to two great nephews and one great niece. I have been very blessed that each one of my sibilings have lived 
                    within twenty minutes of me so I could always see them and their kids. Without them I would be 
                    a lost black and white soul without any personality and for that I will forever love and cherish them.

                <p>
                    I have always gone to church and have had an idea of who Jesus was but I never truly accepted all he 
                    had done and continues to fulfill in peoples lives until June 2018 when I was baptized for the first 
                    time. From that point on God has led me to live a progessively closer relationship with Him and He 
                    greatly blessed me on my journey through young adulthood. One of my favorite verses is Ephesians 6:10 
                    "<i>Be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.</i>"

                    Growing up I have always been super competitive, whetherit was on the field 
                    or in the classroom, I have always been one to try and be the best at everything. In the 
                    classroom it was more about me being the first one done above being the most accurate on the 
                    test so as I progressed through school I had to learn that in order to be the fastest and the 
                    most acurate, I had to know as much as I could before taking the test or doing the homework.
                    I have always loved baseball and soccer, other sports were fun and something extra to do but 
                    they were nothing compared to baseball and soccer until I finally tried track my senior year. Although
                    I was unable to do it my senior year due to covid, I was given the opportunity to try it in college 
                    along with doing baseball and I have loved it, not becuase I was super good, but that it was 
                    hard to be good and only certain people could be good so it became a new challenge and pushes me daily
                    to train and get better and better while still enjoying my love for baseball and keeping up with all of 
                    my studies.
